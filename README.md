#Introduction to Python

Primarily sourced from Univ. of Colorado's [Fall 2013 Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/University-of-Colorado-Computational-Science-and-Engineering/), I believe this is a great repo for an introduction to the art called Python.

##Linux Tutorials

I found these links for other basic introductions:
- [Introduction to Linux](http://researchcomputing.github.io/Meetup-Fall-2013/pdfs/Linuxclass-1.pdf)
- [Data Management in Linux](http://researchcomputing.github.io/Meetup-Fall-2013/pdfs/Linuxclass-2.pdf)
- [Shell Programming](http://researchcomputing.github.io/Meetup-Fall-2013/pdfs/Linuxclass-3.pdf)

Credit, again, is due to the Univ. of Colorado [Research Computing Meet-up page] (http://www.meetup.com/University-of-Colorado-Computational-Science-and-Engineering/).

## Python for Data Analysis

### How does this work?

This repo consists of a bunch of ipython notebooks, which are numbered. So you can go through the notebooks one by one.
There are two kinds of notebooks - lessons and exercises. Self-explanatory I presume.

### Pre-requisites
1. Python
 - currently its a mix of 2.7 and 3.3, but I hope to update all files to 3.3. Feel free to make updates and add pull requests.

2. iPython

### How do I run this?
Clone this repository, then cd into the python folder. From here, run the ipython notebook framework.
```
$cd python
$ipython notebook
```

### Other info
There is a bent towards Data Analysis in this repo - because that's been my primary interest.
